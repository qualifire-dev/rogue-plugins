# Rogue Security — credential storage helper (Google Antigravity plugin).
# Called by the /setup command and the installer.
# Writes ~/.rogue-env (mode 600) which every plugin hook reads at runtime. The
# file is shared with the Claude/Codex/Cursor/Gemini/Copilot plugins (same format).
#
# Usage: setup.sh <api-key> <email> <name>
#
# Hooks read credentials from (in order, later wins):
#   1) ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/env   (bundled defaults, for compiled customer plugins)
#   2) /etc/rogue/env       (system-wide, for MDM deployments)
#   3) ~/.rogue-env         (per-user, written by this script)
