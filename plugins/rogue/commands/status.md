# Rogue Security Status

Check the current status of the Rogue Security AIDR integration. The plugin hooks
source credentials from three locations in order (later wins): the plugin's bundled
`env` (managed installs), `/etc/rogue/env` (MDM-provisioned), and `~/.rogue-env`
(per-user setup). This command checks all three so it works for managed, MDM, and
individual deployments.

## Step 1: Write a credential-source helper and report what's found

Each Bash invocation runs in its own subshell, so steps re-source the chain via a
helper written to `/tmp/`:

```bash
cat > /tmp/rogue-source-env.sh <<'EOF'
PLUGIN_ENV=$(find "$HOME/.claude/plugins" -name env -type f -path '*rogue*' 2>/dev/null | head -1)
[ -n "$PLUGIN_ENV" ] && [ -r "$PLUGIN_ENV" ] && . "$PLUGIN_ENV"
[ -r /etc/rogue/env ]              && . /etc/rogue/env
[ -r "$HOME/.rogue-env" ]          && . "$HOME/.rogue-env"
EOF
chmod +x /tmp/rogue-source-env.sh

# Report which sources contributed
. /tmp/rogue-source-env.sh
echo "Credential sources detected:"
PLUGIN_ENV=$(find "$HOME/.claude/plugins" -name env -type f -path '*rogue*' 2>/dev/null | head -1)
[ -n "$PLUGIN_ENV" ] && echo "  $PLUGIN_ENV  (plugin bundle)"
[ -r /etc/rogue/env ]     && echo "  /etc/rogue/env  (MDM)"
[ -r "$HOME/.rogue-env" ] && echo "  $HOME/.rogue-env  (per-user)"
[ -z "$PLUGIN_ENV" ] && [ ! -r /etc/rogue/env ] && [ ! -r "$HOME/.rogue-env" ] && echo "  (none)"

# Sanity check the resolved key
[ -n "$ROGUE_API_KEY" ] && echo "API key resolved: ...${ROGUE_API_KEY: -4}" || echo "API key: not resolved"
```

If no sources are found OR `ROGUE_API_KEY` is empty after sourcing:

- **Managed deployment users**: contact your security admin — either the plugin
  didn't deploy (Claude management UI) or the MDM script didn't run.
- **Individual users**: run `/rogue:setup` to configure `~/.rogue-env`.

Stop and don't proceed past this step in either of those cases.

## Step 2: Test connection + register heartbeat

Hit the status endpoint with the resolved key. This validates the key, registers
this install in the dashboard's Coding Agents roster, and reports whether a newer
plugin version exists. The plugin version is read from the manifest without
`python3` (absent on a fresh macOS):

```bash
. /tmp/rogue-source-env.sh
PJ=$(find "$HOME/.claude/plugins" -path '*rogue*/.claude-plugin/plugin.json' 2>/dev/null | head -1)
VER=$(grep -oE '"version"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*"[0-9][^"]*"' "$PJ" 2>/dev/null | head -1 | grep -oE '[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+')
case "$(printf '%s' "${CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT:-}" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')" in
  *cowork*)  AGENT="cowork" ;;
  *desktop*) AGENT="desktop" ;;
  *)         AGENT="cli" ;;
esac
curl -s -w "\n%{http_code}" \
  "${ROGUE_BASE_URL:-https://api.rogue.security}/api/v1/hooks/status" \
  -H "x-rogue-api-key: $ROGUE_API_KEY" \
  -H "x-rogue-agent-family: claude" \
  -H "x-rogue-agent: $AGENT" \
  -H "x-rogue-agent-version: ${VER:-unknown}" \
  -H "x-rogue-host: $(hostname)" \
  -H "x-rogue-actor-email: ${ROGUE_ACTOR_EMAIL:-}" \
  -H "x-rogue-actor-name: ${ROGUE_ACTOR_NAME:-}"
```

Report from the JSON response (HTTP 200 = connected):

- **Connected** — `connected: true`
- **Organization** — `organization.name`
- **Version** — `agent.version` (running) vs `agent.latest_version`; if
  `agent.update_available` is `true`, note that auto-update will pick it up.

On failure suggest:

- HTTP 401 → key invalid. Compare the resolved key tail (Step 1) against the
  [API keys dashboard](https://app.rogue.security/settings/api-keys); the
  precedence chain may be picking up a stale source — check Step 1's list.
- HTTP 400 → unexpected (the `x-rogue-agent-family` header above should prevent it).
- No response → confirm network reachability to `api.rogue.security` (or `${ROGUE_BASE_URL}`).

## Step 3: Fetch configuration

If the connection succeeded, fetch the active config:

```bash
. /tmp/rogue-source-env.sh
curl -s -H "x-rogue-api-key: $ROGUE_API_KEY" \
  "${ROGUE_BASE_URL:-https://api.rogue.security}/api/v1/hooks/config"
```

Parse the JSON response and display in a clear format:

- **Mode**: `settings.mode` (enforce or monitor)
- **Fail-open**: `settings.failOpen`
- **Active rulesets**: For each ruleset in `rulesets`, show name, category, mode
  (block/monitor), and severity

## Step 4: Show identity

```bash
. /tmp/rogue-source-env.sh
echo "Actor email: ${ROGUE_ACTOR_EMAIL:-(unset)}"
echo "Actor name:  ${ROGUE_ACTOR_NAME:-(unset)}"
```

If either is unset:

- **Managed deployment**: the MDM script (`mdm-provision-actor.sh`) hasn't run
  yet or ran with empty placeholders. Events are POSTing with blank actor
  headers until MDM provisioning completes. Force an enforcement run on your
  MDM (Kandji "Run library item now", `sudo jamf policy`).
- **Individual user**: re-run `/rogue:setup` to populate identity.

## Step 5: Summary

Present a clean summary combining everything:

- Credential sources found (from Step 1)
- Connection status (Step 2)
- Mode + ruleset count (Step 3)
- Identity (Step 4)

If everything looks good, confirm the integration is active.

## Step 6: False-positive escape hatch

After the summary, tell the user:

> **Was a prompt blocked by mistake?** Prepend `rgx!` to your next prompt and
> resubmit. Rogue will allow that one prompt and mark the previous detection as
> a false positive in your dashboard. The override is per-prompt only —
> subsequent prompts go through normal evaluation.
