# PowerShell half of the log-shipper contract test. The sh/Node half is
# tests/test_ship_logs.sh; design and rationale: docs/plugin-log-shipper.md.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL: ship-logs.ps1 is the Windows half of the feature and
# cannot run on a dev Mac, so until this file was written it had ZERO coverage — and
# that gap cost a real bug. Its Send-OversizeLine fell through to
# `advanceBytes = maxLineBytes`, advancing the offset by a fixed window when no
# newline was found. That lands the offset MID-LINE, and every read after it is a
# fragment. The sh copy had already been fixed to stall instead; nothing compared
# the two, so Windows alone shipped corrupt chunks. The stall case below pins it.
#
# Runs on macOS/Linux: ship-logs.ps1 puts every pure helper above an
# `if ($env:ROGUE_PS_LIB_ONLY) { return }` seam and falls back from USERPROFILE to
# $HOME, which is what lets .github/workflows/validate.yml cover Windows-only code
# on a Linux runner.
#
# Three layers, because the main body (Invoke-Main) exits on non-Windows:
#   * behavioural  — call the helpers directly through the seam.
#   * cross-language — assert the helpers agree BYTE FOR BYTE with what
#     ship-logs.sh writes. All three implementations share ~/.rogue/ship/, so a
#     disagreement about `head=` or `path=` makes each shipper treat the other's
#     state as a different file and re-ship the whole log (duplicate data).
#   * structural   — assert the five callers actually invoke the shipper, with the
#     right slug/family, in a child process rather than in-process.
