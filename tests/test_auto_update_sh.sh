# throwaway HOME, because what matters is the DECISION (did it run the
# installer?), not any single helper.
#
# The regression this guards: the old version string-compared the release tag
# against "v${installed}", which cannot tell newer from older. Once the tag stops
# being a version, that comparison would re-run the installer every 24h forever
# whenever the manifest sat BEHIND the install.

# Ubuntu this really executes under dash. Running the test with bash would leave
# a bashism in the version compare undetected by every gate: the "Shell scripts
# parse" step keys off the shebang and checks it with `bash -n` for the same
# reason. CI runs this file twice, TEST_SH=sh and TEST_SH=dash.
