# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

A Claude Code **plugin** (not an app) that ships Rogue Security AIDR — it observes every Claude Code lifecycle event and POSTs the payload to `https://api.rogue.security/api/v1/hooks/claude` for prompt-injection / secret-exfil / destructive-command detection.

There is no build step for the plugin itself: it's a directory of JSON + shell scripts loaded by Claude Code at session start. The only "build" is `scripts/build-release.sh`, which tars the plugin tree for GitHub Releases.

**Cross-platform by dual dispatcher.** Every event ships TWO implementations — a POSIX-`sh` script (`hook.sh` & friends) for macOS/Linux/WSL and a PowerShell sibling (`hook.ps1` & friends) for **native Windows (no WSL, no Git Bash)**. `hooks.json` registers an `sh` entry and a PowerShell entry for each event; exactly one does real work per machine (see "The hook pattern"). When you change one dispatcher's behavior, change the other to match — keep `hook.sh` / `hook.ps1` in lockstep.

**This repo is now a multi-agent monorepo.** Besides the Claude plugin (`plugins/rogue/`, endpoint `/hooks/claude`) it also ships the **OpenAI Codex** plugin (`plugins/codex/`, endpoint `/hooks/openai`, family `openai`, surface `codex_cli`/`codex_app`) and the **Cursor** plugin (`plugins/cursor/`, endpoint `/hooks/cursor`, header `x-rogue-source: cursor`). The one-line installer (`install.sh` / `install.ps1`) detects **every** supported agent (`claude`, `codex`, `cursor`) and installs the matching Rogue plugin into each, writing the shared `~/.rogue-env` once.

### Codex plugin (`plugins/codex/`)
Mirrors the Claude plugin with deliberate differences:
- **Manifest is `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`**; the Codex marketplace file is `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` (kept separate from the Claude `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` so the shared plugin name `rogue` doesn't collide and Codex never falls back to the Claude marketplace).
- **Codex-native env vars ONLY.** Use `PLUGIN_ROOT` / `PLUGIN_DATA` — never any `CLAUDE_*` variable. Codex exposes `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`/`CLAUDE_CODE_USER_EMAIL` as compat shims, but the Codex plugin must not reference them (`hooks.json` uses `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` / `%PLUGIN_ROOT%`; `actor.sh` cascade is env → `git config` → hostname/whoami).
- **`hook.sh`/`hook.ps1` are PURE RELAY** — no block-detection regex, no local alert. Codex displays the native deny shape itself. (The Claude plugin once shipped a `security-alert` modal because the Claude app hid the block reason; Claude Desktop now shows blocks natively, so that hack was removed everywhere.)
- **No `auto-update.sh`.** Codex has no documented native plugin auto-update, but the updater is speculative + fragile, so v1 omits it; heartbeat's `update_available` drives the dashboard "outdated" badge instead. Re-add (copy Claude's) only if a confirmed gap needs silent push.
- No `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT` gate (Codex doesn't set it; the hook only ever fires from Codex's own `hooks.json`).
- **Hook trust**: Codex hashes the whole hook definition and skips untrusted command hooks until reviewed via `/hooks`. Keep `hooks.json` command strings (POSIX `command` + Windows `commandWindows`) **byte-identical forever**; mutate only `scripts/*` so trust survives updates. Setup/status commands document the one-time `/hooks` trust step.

### Cursor plugin (`plugins/cursor/`)
A near-verbatim port of `qualifire-dev/rogue-plugin-cursor`'s `plugins/rogue/` (keep it in sync — re-pull on upstream changes). Mirrors the Claude/Codex dual-dispatcher with Cursor-native wiring:
- **Dual dispatcher (sh + PowerShell), PURE RELAY.** Each of the 18 Cursor events registers two `hooks.json` entries — `sh ./scripts/hook.sh <event>` (cwd-relative; Cursor runs hooks from the plugin root) and a PowerShell entry that loads `scripts/hook.ps1` via `$env:CURSOR_PLUGIN_ROOT`. Exactly one runs per machine (same arbitration as Claude). Endpoint `/api/v1/hooks/cursor`, header `x-rogue-source: cursor`, env var `CURSOR_PLUGIN_ROOT`. Reuses the shared `~/.rogue-env`. `setup.sh` / `setup.ps1` write it.
- **Manifest is `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`** (version is source of truth); the Cursor marketplace file is the repo-root `.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json` (source `./plugins/cursor`, plugin version must match plugin.json — enforced by `.github/workflows/validate.yml`), kept separate from `.claude-plugin/` and `.agents/plugins/`.
- **No `auto-update.sh`.** The Cursor **Team Marketplace** (admin imports the repo via Dashboard) IS Cursor's native managed/auto-update path — we don't ship a script. Per-developer one-liner installs upgrade by re-running the installer.
- **`commands/{setup,status}.md`**, not `skills/` — Cursor's slash-command format.

### Gemini CLI extension (`plugins/gemini/`)
A native **Gemini CLI extension** (endpoint `/hooks/gemini`, family `gemini`, surface `gemini_cli`). Deliberately breaks from the sh+PowerShell dual-dispatcher of the other three because **Gemini CLI guarantees Node 20+ on PATH** (every install method requires it; the Homebrew formula declares `node` a dependency; there is no bundled-runtime/SEA build). So:
- **One cross-platform Node ESM hook** — `scripts/hook.mjs` (plus `setup.mjs`, `heartbeat.mjs`), Node built-ins only (global `fetch`, `node:fs/os/path/child_process`). **No `curl`, no `jq`, no dependencies, no build step, and NO sh/ps lockstep.** Don't "port" it back to shell — the single-script model is the point.
- **Manifest is `gemini-extension.json`** (at the plugin root, version is source of truth). **NO marketplace file** — Gemini installs from a repo/archive/local dir, so the version-sync check in `validate.yml` does not cover it. **Hooks live in `hooks/hooks.json`** (a Gemini extension convention — NOT in the manifest), one `command` per event: `node "${extensionPath}${/}scripts${/}hook.mjs" <Event>`, timeout **20000ms** (units are ms; the fetch timeout is 15000ms, inside the budget). `${extensionPath}${/}` makes one command string work on Windows and macOS.
- **PURE RELAY** — the backend emits Gemini's native decision shapes (`{"decision":"deny"|"block","reason":...}`, `toolConfig.mode:"NONE"`), so `hook.mjs` relays the response verbatim and Gemini renders the block. Fail-open `{}` on missing key / network error / non-200 / bad response; **always exit 0** (a block is carried in the relayed JSON body, per Gemini's structured-output contract — not the exit code).
- **Events**: **the full Gemini hook set is registered and POSTed to `/hooks/gemini`** (send-everything for audit + enforcement) — **only `AfterModel` is excluded**. Registered/monitored: `SessionStart, BeforeAgent, BeforeModel, AfterAgent, BeforeTool, AfterTool, BeforeToolSelection, SessionEnd, Notification, PreCompress`. **Block/enforce:** `BeforeAgent, AfterAgent, BeforeTool, AfterTool` (the backend's `gemini_cli.blockingEvents`). **MCP calls/responses ride `BeforeTool`/`AfterTool`** (the parser keys off `mcp_context`). **`AfterModel` is intentionally NOT registered** — per Google's hook spec it fires once per streamed response chunk (would double-count content already captured whole at `AfterAgent`). **Audit-only** (POSTed, never blocks — Gemini ignores their decision): `SessionStart` (also fires the detached heartbeat + unconfigured hint, then falls through to POST), `BeforeToolSelection` (filter-capable via `toolConfig.mode:"NONE"`, but monitor-only for v1), `SessionEnd` (best-effort — Gemini "will not wait" for it on exit), `Notification`, `PreCompress`. Mechanically, `hook.mjs` already POSTs any event that isn't `SessionStart` through its generic path, so capturing the new four was pure `hooks.json` registration; the only script change was making `SessionStart` fall through to the POST after firing its heartbeat.
- **Hook trust**: like Codex, Gemini fingerprints the hook `command` and skips it until reviewed via `/hooks`. Keep the `command` strings byte-stable forever; mutate only `scripts/*.mjs`. `/setup` documents the one-time trust step.
- **Credentials**: reads the shared `~/.rogue-env` (mode 600) from disk each invocation, via the same env-file precedence as the other plugins (`${extensionPath}/env` → `/etc/rogue/env` / `C:\ProgramData\rogue\env` → `~/.rogue-env`). No manifest `settings[]` (that targets MCP env injection and would prompt a keychain entry on install). Actor cascade: env → `git config --global` → hostname/whoami.
- **`commands/setup.toml`** (user-invoked TOML slash command — writes creds) + **`skills/status/SKILL.md`** (model-invocable, read-only) — mirroring Claude's disable-model-invocation split within Gemini's surfaces. **No `auto-update`** — Gemini has native `gemini extensions update`; monorepo installs upgrade by re-running the one-liner.

### Multi-agent install (`install.sh` / `install.ps1`)
The single one-line installer detects every supported agent (`have_cmd claude` / `have_cmd codex` / `have_cmd cursor || [ -d ~/.cursor ]` / `have_cmd gemini`; PowerShell uses `Get-Command` / `Test-Path`), writes the shared `~/.rogue-env` **once** (`configure_credentials`), then installs each. **Claude and Codex use their native plugin CLIs** (`claude plugin install` / `codex plugin add rogue@rogue-marketplace` against the same monorepo — git-clones the marketplace, no local files). **Cursor has NO plugin CLI** — `cursor_install_plugin` downloads the release tarball (`rogue-plugin-cursor.tar.gz`) and copies `plugins/cursor/` into `~/.cursor/plugins/local/rogue` (`%USERPROFILE%\.cursor\plugins\local\rogue` on Windows). **Gemini HAS a native extension CLI but expects the manifest at a source root** — so `gemini_install_extension` downloads `rogue-plugin-gemini.tar.gz` (whose **top dir IS the extension**, manifest at its root — see `build-release.sh`), extracts it, and runs `gemini extensions install <dir>` (uninstall-then-install so a re-run upgrades). This copy-vs-CLI-vs-native-CLI asymmetry is load-bearing — preserve it. Adding a CLI agent = one detect line + one `*_install_plugin` function; Codex and Gemini print the one-time `/hooks` trust reminder.

## Repo layout (load-bearing pieces)

- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — Claude marketplace manifest. Points at `./plugins/rogue`. (`.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` → `./plugins/codex`; `.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json` → `./plugins/cursor`, the Cursor Team-Marketplace import target.)
- `plugins/rogue/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — plugin manifest. **`version` here is the source of truth** — `build-release.sh` reads it, and `auto-update.sh` compares it against the latest GitHub release tag (`v${version}`).
- `plugins/rogue/hooks/hooks.json` — 11 lifecycle hooks, all `type: "command"`. **Every event registers two entries** (an `sh` one and a PowerShell one) — see below.
- `plugins/rogue/scripts/hook.sh` — POSIX-`sh` + `curl` dispatcher (macOS/Linux/WSL). Invoked via `sh` (NOT `bash`), so it is kept POSIX-clean (tested under `dash` via `tests/test_hook_sh.sh`). **Stands down** (emits `{}`, exits) under Git Bash (`uname` = MINGW/MSYS/CYGWIN) so the PowerShell entry owns native Windows.
- `plugins/rogue/scripts/hook.ps1` — PowerShell + `Invoke-WebRequest` dispatcher. Owns native Windows; stands down on non-Windows (`pwsh` on macOS/Linux). Mirrors `hook.sh` stage-for-stage AND replicates Claude's block detection, native modal, logging, and SessionStart unconfigured hint.
- `plugins/rogue/scripts/setup.sh` / `setup.ps1` — write `~/.rogue-env` (mode 600) / `%USERPROFILE%\.rogue-env` (ACL-restricted) with `ROGUE_API_KEY` / `ROGUE_ACTOR_EMAIL` / `ROGUE_ACTOR_NAME`. Both emit the same `export KEY=value` POSIX-quoted format. Called by `/rogue:setup`.
- `plugins/rogue/scripts/auto-update.sh` / `auto-update.ps1` — fire (detached) from `SessionStart`. Rate-limited once/24h. Re-invoke the matching one-line installer (`install.sh` / `install.ps1`) when a newer release tag exists.
- `plugins/rogue/scripts/heartbeat.sh` / `heartbeat.ps1` — SessionStart presence beacon (detached). POST `/api/v1/hooks/status`.
- `plugins/rogue/scripts/warn.sh` — SessionStart "not configured" nudge (sh path only; the ps1 path emits the hint inline from `hook.ps1`).
- `plugins/rogue/skills/{setup,status}/SKILL.md` — slash commands (`/rogue:setup`, `/rogue:status`) in the skills format. **Instructions to Claude**, not scripts — Claude runs the bash/PowerShell inside them step-by-step (each carries macOS/Linux and Windows variants). `setup` sets `disable-model-invocation: true` (it writes credentials, so user-invoke only); `status` is read-only and model-invocable. Auto-discovered from `skills/` — no manifest entry needed.
- `install.sh` / `install.ps1` — one-line installers. Both add the marketplace via the Claude CLI (`claude plugin marketplace add` + `claude plugin install`) — they do NOT download the release tarball.
- `scripts/build-release.sh` + `.github/workflows/release.yml` — tag-driven release pipeline. Pushing a `v*` tag builds a single cross-platform `dist/rogue-plugin-claude.tar.gz` (both `.sh` and `.ps1` scripts) and attaches it to the release. The artifact filename intentionally has **no version and no OS suffix** so `/latest/` URLs stay stable. (The tarball is consumed by `compile-customer-plugin.sh` for MDM bundles; the marketplace install clones the repo directly.)

## The hook pattern

Every event registers two entries — an `sh` one and a PowerShell one — pointing at the matching dispatcher:

```json
{ "type": "command",
  "command": "sh \"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/hook.sh\" PreToolUse ; exit 0",
  "timeout": 20 },
{ "type": "command",
  "command": "powershell -NoProfile -NonInteractive -Command \"& ([scriptblock]::Create((Get-Content -Raw -LiteralPath (Join-Path (Get-Item Env:CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT).Value 'scripts/hook.ps1')))) PreToolUse\" ; exit 0",
  "timeout": 20 }
```

**Every command string is an sh + PowerShell 5.1 polyglot that always exits 0.** Claude Code runs shell-form hook commands via `sh -c` on macOS/Linux, **Git Bash** on Windows when Git is installed, and **PowerShell** (pwsh, else powershell.exe 5.1) on Windows without Git Bash — and it shows a visible "hook error" notice for **any non-zero exit** (stderr is hidden only on exit 0). So each command must parse and exit 0 under all three shells; `tests/test_hooks_json.sh` lints exactly this. The polyglot rules:

- End every command with `; exit 0` — the only construct that swallows a missing-binary failure in both sh (`exit 127` → `exit 0`) and PS 5.1 (command-not-found is non-terminating; execution continues to `exit 0`). Never use `||` or `&&` — both are PS 5.1 *parse* errors, which fail the whole command including the `exit 0`.
- No `$` anywhere in the PowerShell entries. Under Git Bash the whole command is parsed by *bash*, which expands `$env` inside double quotes and mangles the path. Read the plugin root as `(Get-Item Env:CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT).Value` instead of `$env:CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`.
- Backgrounding (`( nohup ... & )`) only inside a single-quoted `sh -c '...'` wrapper — a single-quoted string is one inert token to PS 5.1, whereas a bare `&` is a parse error. Inside those single quotes use `"$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT"` (the env var, exported to every hook process), not the `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` placeholder — sh doesn't expand placeholders inside single quotes.
- The `shell: "powershell"` hook field is NOT a platform gate: on a Mac without pwsh it throws a visible "no PowerShell executable found" error. Don't use it.

`scripts/hook.sh <EventName>` is the orchestrator: stands down under Git Bash, sources env files, fail-opens on missing API key, sources `scripts/actor.sh` for actor resolution, POSTs stdin to `/api/v1/hooks/claude` with the four `x-rogue-*` headers, parses the response for a block decision (log-only), and prints the API response to stdout. `hook.ps1` does the same on Windows. Logs every invocation to `$ROGUE_LOG_FILE` (default `~/.rogue/hook.log` / `%USERPROFILE%\.rogue\hook.log`); the logged `reason` is sanitized of control characters to prevent log forgery from server-controlled text.

### Exactly-one-runs (cross-platform arbitration)

Claude Code runs **all** entries for an event (each under the platform's hook shell — see the polyglot rules above). The two entries are arranged so exactly one does real work per machine, and the other exits 0 silently:

| Environment (hook shell) | `sh` entry | PowerShell entry |
|---|---|---|
| macOS / Linux / WSL (`sh -c`) | runs (curl POST) | `powershell` absent → 127 → `; exit 0`, silent |
| native Windows + Git Bash (bash) | `uname`=MINGW/MSYS/CYGWIN → scripts **stand down** (`{}`) | bash finds `powershell.exe` on PATH → runs |
| native Windows, no Git Bash (PowerShell) | `sh` not recognized (non-terminating) → `; exit 0`, silent | runs (nested `powershell` spawn) |

The Git Bash stand-down matters because Git Bash's `~` maps to `%USERPROFILE%` — the SAME creds `hook.ps1` reads — so without it both entries would POST (and double-alert on a block). It lives in the *scripts* (`hook.sh`, `warn.sh`, `auto-update.sh`, `heartbeat.sh` all check `uname`), not in the command strings.

**No `-File` on the PowerShell entry.** Logic loads via `[scriptblock]::Create((Get-Content ...))` so ExecutionPolicy never applies (this also survives a GPO-enforced policy, which `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` does not). The plugin root is read via `(Get-Item Env:CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT).Value` at runtime — dollar-free so Git Bash can't mangle it (see polyglot rules).

`scripts/warn.sh` is the SessionStart "not configured" nudge (sh path; `hook.ps1` emits the hint inline on the Windows path). `auto-update.{sh,ps1}` are the SessionStart background updaters. `heartbeat.{sh,ps1}` are the SessionStart background presence beacons — fire-and-forget `POST /api/v1/hooks/status` (JSON body: `agent_family: "claude"` fixed enum, `agent` display label from `$CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT`, `version` from `plugin.json` via grep/sed or regex, `host`, actor fields) that registers the install in the dashboard's Coding Agents roster and learns `update_available`. Reads the plugin version without `python3` for the fresh-macOS reason below.

Invariants to preserve when editing hooks (apply to **both** dispatchers — keep them in lockstep):

- **Resolve env files in this precedence order** — `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/env` (bundled defaults), then `/etc/rogue/env` (MDM) / `C:\ProgramData\rogue\env`, then `$HOME/.rogue-env` / `%USERPROFILE%\.rogue-env` (per-user). Later wins; process env wins over all files. `hook.sh` `source`s the files (valid POSIX sh); `hook.ps1` regex-parses the same `export KEY=value` lines and decodes the shell quoting via `ConvertFrom-ShellQuoted` so values round-trip identically. Never source from a world-writable path like `/tmp`.
- **Actor cascade lives in `scripts/actor.sh`** (sh) / is inlined in `hook.ps1` (ps). Per-var fallback: existing env → `git config --global user.{email,name}` → `CLAUDE_CODE_USER_EMAIL` (local-part as name) → `hostname`/`whoami` (`COMPUTERNAME`/`USERNAME`) last-resort. Resolved every hook; no on-disk cache.
- **Fail-open is layered** — the dispatcher emits `{}` on missing API key or any HTTP failure, and every command string ends `; exit 0` so a dead dispatcher (missing binary, crashed script) is a silent success with empty stdout rather than a visible hook error. Never reintroduce `|| echo '{}'`-style wrappers — `||` is a PS 5.1 parse error (see the polyglot rules).
- **`x-rogue-event` must match the hook's key** in `hooks.json`. The server routes on this header. There is **no** `x-rogue-source` header (that is cursor-only).
- Block detection covers `"decision":"block"`, `"continue":false`, `"permissionDecision":"deny"`, `"behavior":"deny"`; reason from `permissionDecisionReason`→`reason`→`stopReason`→`message`. It exists for LOGGING ONLY (`outcome=block reason=...` in the hook log) — both dispatchers relay the response verbatim and Claude (CLI and Desktop/Cowork) renders the block natively. Don't reintroduce a local modal/notification.
- Timeouts: every hook `timeout` in `hooks.json` is **20s**; the synchronous dispatcher's HTTP client (`hook.sh` `curl --max-time`, `hook.ps1` `Invoke-WebRequest -TimeoutSec`) is **15s** so a slow request fails *inside* the hook budget (clean fail-open) rather than being hard-killed at the timeout. The budget is generous because Windows pays a PowerShell cold-start before the request even begins; the happy path is unaffected (the timeout only bites on a hung request). The detached SessionStart scripts (`heartbeat`, `auto-update`) run in the background, so their own HTTP timeouts are independent of the hook timeout.

## Releasing

1. Bump `version` in **both** `plugins/rogue/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (the marketplace lists the plugin's version too — keep them in sync).
2. Commit, tag `vX.Y.Z`, push the tag. The `release.yml` workflow checks out the tag, runs `scripts/build-release.sh`, and creates the GitHub Release with the single `rogue-plugin-claude.tar.gz`.
3. `auto-update.{sh,ps1}` on user machines pick up the new release on the next `SessionStart` (rate-limited 24h). One-line users can also re-run the installer.

## Things that look weird but are intentional

- Hooks are shell one-liners, not script files referenced directly. This keeps the manifest self-contained for `/plugin install`.
- Each event has **two** entries (`sh` + PowerShell). On any given machine only one produces output; the other hits a missing binary (silenced by `; exit 0`) or its script stands down. Asymmetric but correct per platform — see the exactly-one-runs table.
- Command strings look over-defensive (`; exit 0` everywhere, dollar-free PowerShell, `sh -c '...'` around backgrounding). Each quirk dodges a real parse/expansion failure in one of the three hook shells — `tests/test_hooks_json.sh` enforces them; don't "clean them up".
- The PowerShell entry loads logic via `[scriptblock]::Create((Get-Content ...))` rather than `-File`, to dodge ExecutionPolicy/GPO without `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`. Don't "simplify" it to `-File`.
- The `SessionStart` event has **four separate hook groups** (auto-update kick-off, heartbeat kick-off, unconfigured-warning, API POST). They run independently so a failure in one doesn't suppress the others. auto-update/heartbeat are detached (`sh -c '( nohup ... & )'` on sh; `Start-Process -WindowStyle Hidden` on PowerShell) with short timeouts — the hook returns immediately. Don't "fix" the short timeout.
- Release tarballs deliberately omit BOTH the version and an OS suffix from the filename, so `/releases/latest/download/rogue-plugin-claude.tar.gz` stays stable. The package is cross-platform by content (ships `.sh` and `.ps1`).
- `install.sh` / `install.ps1` install via the Claude CLI marketplace (git clone), NOT by downloading the tarball. The tarball exists for `compile-customer-plugin.sh` (MDM bundles).
- `rgx!` prompt prefix is a server-side convention (false-positive escape hatch). The plugin itself doesn't parse it — the API does.
